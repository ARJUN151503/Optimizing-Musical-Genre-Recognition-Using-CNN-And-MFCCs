# Optimizing-Musical-Genre-Recognition-Using-CNN-And-MFCCs
This study investigates the application of Convolutional Neural  Networks (CNN). for the bracket of music stripes using the  GTZAN dataset, which includes 1000 tracks divided into 10  stripes. Each audio train is converted into Mel- frequence  Cepstral Portions (MFCCs), an extensively- used point in audio  analysis.
